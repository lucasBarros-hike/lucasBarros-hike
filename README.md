Why Programming?

    Whereas technology is always marked as being the sector of the future, with great potential, safety and revenue for anyone who want to work on the area, 
    there are other reasons for me to choose it (Of course, revenue and safety are on the list, I'm human after all).  

    First, I’m fascinated for learning and discovering, and technology it’s all about that! Everyday a new process is created, 
    a problem is solved or a system is developed, being basically impossible to reach a skill ceiling on that area. Thus, 
    there is always a space to become better each new day. 	 

    However, I also have always loved to learn about language and speech, to be able to communicate an idea, 
    followed by solving those logical problems that my math teacher from elementary school used to pass. 
    Consequently, with programming I was able to unite the best of those two worlds.
