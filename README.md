<h1>Who Am I?</h1>

<i>“Hi, I'm @lucasBarros-hike, a brazilian programming student who’s looking for a career on that area, nice to meet you!”</i> Or I would say if you were looking for a short presentation, but if you're looking for a real presentation of me, it would look more like that:  

Hello, I’m Lucas!<br/> A student with a craving for learning that loves to be challenged and expand his knowledge of the world<br/> A professional that seeks efficiency and logic, continuously doing his best to solve any problem he can be facing<br/> A coworker who likes to listen and to suggest the best for the team<br/> A creative mind looking for improvement<br/> A person that dedicates everyday to become the best version of himself<br/> A spirit who loves to read, teach and tell stories<br/>

In general, <strong>a good old daydreamer</strong>, It’s a pleasure to meet you!<br/>

<h1>Why Programming?</h1>

<p>Whereas technology is always marked as being the sector of the future, with great potential, safety and revenue for anyone who want to work on the area, there are other reasons for me to choose it (Of course, revenue and safety are on the list, I'm human after all).</p>

<p>First, I’m fascinated for learning and discovering, and technology it’s all about that! Everyday a new process is created, a problem is solved or a system is developed, being basically impossible to reach a skill ceiling on that area. Thus,  there is always a space to become better each new day. However, I also have always loved to learn about language and speech, to be able to communicate an idea, as I also did to solve those logical problems that my math teacher from elementary school used to pass. Consequently, with programming I was able to unite the best of those two worlds, language and logic. </p>

<h1>What Are My Objectives?</h1>

<p>Short and clearly, as a programmer, my main objective for now is to become an official programmer. I'm currently looking for ways to work on the area and benefit other people with my skills, if you find yourself with a problem to be solved by good old code, feel free to contact me on linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-barros-2bb72b1b8/
